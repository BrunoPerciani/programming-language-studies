# Python Programming Language Studies 🐍

This repository is my personal learning log for studying the Python programming language through hands on practice in Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks here were developed as assignments for the university course **Information Processing**, under the guidance of **Prof. João Marcelo Borovina Josko**. My goal is to build a strong foundation in core programming concepts and gradually connect that knowledge to real world workflows!

## 📌 About this repository

The notebooks follow a learning path that starts with fundamentals and moves toward practical problem solving. Each class notebook includes explanations, examples, and exercises that I used to consolidate the topic of the day. Over time, this repository will evolve into a structured reference that I can revisit when building scripts, tools, or analysis pipelines.

## 📚 Contents

The repository is organized as a sequence of class notebooks. It currently includes topics such as fundamental concepts, sequential algorithms, selection structures, repetition structures, modularization, vectors or arrangements, and matrices, plus a final project notebook that consolidates what was learned across the course.

## ▶️ How to run

You can open the notebooks directly on GitHub, or run them locally with Jupyter. If you run locally, make sure you have a Python environment available and Jupyter installed. Some notebooks may also benefit from common data libraries depending on the exercises used in class.

## 📝 Notes

This is a study focused repository. The emphasis is on clarity, incremental learning, and keeping each notebook understandable as a standalone reference.
